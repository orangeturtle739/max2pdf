Paper Manager
=============

A hacked version of Simon Glass' [paperman](https://github.com/sglass68/paperman)
which exposes only a very simple command line interface for converting a max
file to a PDF file:
```
Usage:
max2pdf <file.max> <file.pdf>
```

## Installation

**Gentoo:** See `media-gfx/max2pdf` in https://github.com/orangeturtle739/panther.
